5. Calculate the area of a circle taking radius as input (use `Math.PI`).

II. Control Flow (If-Else, Switch)

6. Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
7. Find the largest of three numbers using nested `if-else`.
8. Create a simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using a `switch` case.
9. Check if a character is a vowel or consonant using `switch`.
10. Determine the grade of a student based on marks (90+=A, 80+=B, etc.).

III. Loops & Number Logic

11. Write a program to find the factorial of a number.
12. Generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci series.
13. Check if a given number is a Prime number.
14. Reverse a given integer (e.g., input: 1234, output: 4321).
15. Check if a number is a Palindrome (e.g., 121).
16. Check if a number is an Armstrong number (e.g., ).
17. Calculate the sum of digits of a number.
18. Find the GCD (HCF) and LCM of two numbers.
19. Print all prime numbers between 1 and 100.
20. Convert a binary number to decimal and vice-versa.
21. check for strong number.
22. count the digits of number.

Arrays (Single & Multi-dimensional)

27. Find the sum and average of elements in an array.
28. Find the maximum and minimum element in an array.
29. Find the second largest number in an array.
30. Reverse an array in place (without creating a new array).
31. Sort an array using Bubble Sort.
32. Perform Linear Search to find an element.
33. Perform Binary Search on a sorted array.
34. Remove duplicate elements from an array.
35. Add two 2D matrices.

37. Rotate an array `k` times to the right.

 String Manipulation

38. Reverse a string (e.g., "Java" -> "avaJ").
39. Check if a string is a palindrome.
40. Count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
41. Find the frequency of each character in a string.

43. Reverse the words in a sentence (e.g., "Hello World" -> "World Hello").
44. Find the first non-repeating character in a string.
45. Convert a String to an Integer (`atoi` logic) without using `Integer.parseInt`.

 OOP & Collections

48. Find common elements between two `ArrayLists`.
49. Count the occurrence of words in a text using `HashMap`.
50. Sort an `ArrayList` of custom objects (e.g., Students) using `Comparable` or `Comparator`.
